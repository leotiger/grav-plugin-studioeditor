# Grav Studio Editor Plugin

The **Studio Editor Plugin** for [Grav](http://github.com/getgrav/grav) provides an advanced markdown editor with Live preview and WYSIWYG controls and support for extended markdown features. The plugin allows to activate some nice extra features, e.g. if you use webp plugin the plugin will automatically replace calls to jpg and png files to the corresponding webp version if it exists without using redirection.

The plugin at it's current state, v1.1.1 has issues with the Flex Objects plugin. To access the Flex Objects plugin configuration you have to disable the Studio Editor plugin and reactivate it after touching the Flex Objects configuration.

### Installation

You will have to download the plugin from GitHub while it's not available in the GRAV universe and extract it to your plugin folder.
