# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Right now StudioEditor is based on quite old Javascript libraries for markdown parsing. This may raise some security issues. If the plugin finds some broader audience that justifies efforts, roadmap is to substitute old libraries with new and maintained parsesrs like Markdown-it. As the plugin is used from within restricted areas of a GRAV instance possible vulnerabilities can't be considered severe as long as GRAV instance owners can trust their authorized users. Nevertheless, the upgrade path for StudioEditor has to be focussed on implementing maintained and security aware javascript libraries.
